# conFusion Restaurant website
I created this website by following coursera's online course on Angular.js.  
This website uses several features of Angular.js including two way databinding using controllers and models,
use of ngResource for asynchronous data loading, and use of angular-ui-router for creating a single page application.

## Installation and usage
You must have node.js and bower installed to use this project.  To install, clone this
repository then run `npm install` and `bower install` in its directory.  This project depends on json-server.
You may install json-server by running `sudo npm install -g json-server`.  You may launch the project by running
`json-server --watch db.json` in project directory and pointing your web browser to localhost:3000.
